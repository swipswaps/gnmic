Features # Full support for gNMI RPCs Every gNMI RPC has a corresponding command with all of the RPC options configurable by means of the local and global flags. YANG-based path suggestions Your CLI magically becomes a YANG browser when gnmic is executed in prompt mode. In this mode the flags that take XPATH values will get auto-suggestions based on the provided YANG modules. In other words - voodoo magic Multi-target operations Commands can operate on multiple gNMI targets for bulk configuration/retrieval/subscription. File based configuration gnmic supports configurations provided in a file . The configuration options are consistent with the CLI flags. Multiple subscriptions With file based configuration it is possible to define and configure multiple subscriptions which can be independently associated with gNMI targets. Inspect gNMI messages With the textproto output format and the logging capabilities of gnmic you can see the actual gNMI messages being sent/received. Its like having a gNMI looking glass! Configurable TLS enforcement gNMI client supports both TLS and non-TLS transports so you can start using it in a lab environment without having to care about the PKI. Dial-out telemetry The dial-out telemetry server is provided for Nokia SR OS. Pre-built multi-platform binaries Statically linked binaries made in our release pipeline are available for major operating systems and architectures. Making installation a breeze! Extensive and friendly documentation You won't be in need to dive into the source code to understand how gnimc works, our documentation site has you covered.

The prompt mode delivers two major features: simplifies gnmic commands and flags navigation, as every option is suggested and auto-completed provides interactive YANG path auto-suggestions for get , set , subscribe commands effectively making the terminal your YANG browser Using the prompt interface # Depending on the cursor position in the prompt line, a so-called suggestion box pops up with contextual auto-completions. The user can enter the suggestion box by pressing the TAB key. The \u2191 and \u2193 keys can be used to navigate the suggestion list. Select the suggested menu item with SPACE key or directly commit your command with ENTER , its that easy! The following most-common key bindings will work in the prompt mode: Key combination Description Option/Control + \u2192/\u2190 move cursor a word right/left Control + W delete a word to the left Control + Z delete a path element in the xpath string ( example ) Control + A move cursor to the beginning of a line Control + E move cursor to the end of a line Control + C discard the current line Control + D exit prompt Control + K delete the line after the cursor to the clipboard Control + U delete the line before the cursor to the clipboard Control + L clear screen Commands and flags suggestions # To make gnmic configurable and flexible we introduced a considerable amount of flags and sub-commands. To help the users navigate the sheer selection of gnmic configuration options, the prompt mode will auto-suggest the global flags, sub-commands and local flags of those sub-commands. When the prompt mode is launched, the suggestions will be shown for the top-level commands and all the global flags. Once the sub-command is typed into the terminal, the auto-suggestions will be provided for the commands nested under this command and its local flags. In the following demo we show how the command and flag suggestions work. As the prompt starts, the suggestion box immediately hints what commands and global flags are available for input as well as their description. The user starts with adding the global flags --address, --insecure, --username and then selects the capabilities command and commits it. This results in gNMI Capability RPC execution against a specified target. Mixed mode # Its perfectly fine to specify some global flags outside of the prompt command and add more within the prompt mode. For example, the following is a valid invocation: gnmic --insecure --username admin --password admin --address 10.1.0.11 prompt Here the prompt will start with with the insecure, username, password, address flags set. YANG-completions # One of the most challenging problems in the network automation field is to process the YANG models and traverse YANG trees to construct the requests used against the network elements. Be it gNMI, NETCONF or RESTCONF a users still needs to have a path pointing to specific YANG-defined node which is targeted by a request. In gNMI paths can be represented in a human readable XPATH-like form - /a/b/c[key=val]/d - and these paths are based on the underlying YANG models. The problem at hand was how to get these paths interactively, or even better - walk the YANG tree from within the CLI and dynamically build the path used in a gNMI RPC? With YANG-completions feature embedded in gnmic what used to be a dream is now a reality \ud83c\udf89 Let us explain what just happened there. In the demonstration above, we called the gnmic with the well-known flags defining the gNMI target ( address , username , password ). But this time we also added a few YANG specific flags ( --file and --dir ) that load the full set of Nokia SR OS YANG models and the 3 rd party models SR OS rely on. gnmic --address 10.1.0.11 --insecure --username admin --password admin \\ --file ~/7x50_YangModels/YANG/nokia-combined \\ --dir ~/7x50_YangModels/YANG \\ prompt In the background gnmic processed these YANG models to build the entire schema tree of the Nokia SR OS state and configuration datastores. With that in-mem stored information, gnmic was able to auto-suggest all the possible YANG paths when the user entered the --path flag which accepts gNMI paths. By using the auto-suggestion hints, a user navigated the /state tree of a router and drilled down to the version-number leaf that, in the end, was retrieved with the gNMI Get RPC. YANG-driven path suggestions gnmic is now capable of reading and processing YANG modules to enable live path auto-suggestions YANG processing # For the YANG-completion feature to work its absolutely imperative for gnmic to successfully parse and compile the YANG models. The prompt command leverages the --file and --dir flags to select the YANG models for processing. With the --file flag a user specifies a file path to a YANG file or a directory of them that gnmic will read and process. If it points to a directory it will be visited recursively reading in all *.yang files it finds. The --dir flag also points to a YANG file or a directory and indicates which additional YANG files might be required. For example, if the YANG modules that a user specified with the --file flag import or include modules that were not part of the path specified with --file , they need to be added with the --dir flag. The Examples section provide some good practical examples on how these two flags can be used together to process the YANG models from different vendors. Understanding path suggestions # When gnmic provides a user with the path suggestions it does it in a smart and intuitive way. First, it understands in what part of the tree a user currently is and suggests only the next possible elements. Additionally, the suggested next path elements will be augmented with the information extracted from the YANG model, such as: element description, as given in the YANG description statement for the element element configuration state ( rw / ro ), as defined in section 4.2.3 of RFC 7950 . node type: The containers and lists will be denoted with the [+] marker, which means that a user can type / char after them to receive suggestions for the nested elements. the [\u22ef] character belongs to a leaf-list element. an empty space will indicate the leaf element. Examples # The examples in this section will show how to use the --file and --dir flags of the prompt command with the YANG collections from different vendors and standard bodies.

The full command with the gNMI target specified could look like this: gnmic --address 10.1.0.11 --insecure --username admin --password admin \\ prompt \\ --file ~/7x50_YangModels/YANG/nokia-combined \\ --dir ~/7x50_YangModels/YANG Openconfig # YANG repo: openconfig/public Clone the OpenConfig repository: git clone https://github.com/openconfig/public cd public Start gnmic in prompt mode and read in all the modules: gnmic --file release/models \\ --dir third_party \\ --exclude ietf-interfaces \\ prompt Note With OpenConfig models we have to use --exclude flag to exclude ietf-interfaces module from being clashed with OpenConfig interfaces module. Cisco # YANG repo: YangModels/yang Clone the YangModels/yang repo and change into the main directory of the repo: git clone https://github.com/YangModels/yang cd yang/vendor IOS-XR # The IOS-XR native YANG models are disaggregated and spread all over the place. Although its technically possible to load them all in one go, this approach will produce a lot of top-level modules making the navigation quite hard. An easier and cleaner approach would be to find the relevant module(s) and load them separately or in small batches. For example here we load BGP config and operational models together: gnmic --file vendor/cisco/xr/721/Cisco-IOS-XR-um-router-bgp-cfg.yang \\ --file vendor/cisco/xr/721/Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-bgp-oper.yang \\ --dir standard/ietf \\ prompt Note We needed to include the ietf/ directory by means of the --dir flag, since the Cisco's native modules rely on the IETF modules and these modules are not in the same directory as the BGP modules. The full command that you can against the real Cisco IOS-XR node must have a target defined, the encoding set and origin suggestions enabled. Here is what it can look like: gnmic -a 10.10.30.5:57500 --insecure -e json_ietf -u admin -p Cisco123 \\ prompt \\ --file yang/vendor/cisco/xr/662/Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-bgp-cfg.yang \\ --file yang/vendor/cisco/xr/662/Cisco-IOS-XR-ipv4-bgp-oper.yang \\ --dir yang/standard/ietf \\ --suggest-with-origin NX-OS # Cisco NX-OS native modules, on the other hand, are aggregated in a single file, here is how you can generate the suggestions from it: gnmic --file vendor/cisco/xr/721/Cisco-IOS-XR-um-router-bgp-cfg.yang \\ --dir standard/ietf \\ prompt Juniper # YANG repo: Juniper/yang Clone the Juniper YANG repository and change into the release directory: git clone https://github.com/Juniper/yang cd yang/20.3/20.3R1 Start gnmic and generate path suggestions for the whole configuration tree of Juniper MX: gnmic --file junos/conf --dir common prompt Note Juniper models are constructed in a way that a top-level container appears to be /configuration , that will not work with your gNMI Subscribe RPC. Instead, you should omit this top level container. So, for example, the suggested path /configuration/interfaces/interface/state should become /interfaces/interface/state . Juniper vMX doesn't support gNMI Get RPC, if you plan to test it, use gNMI Subscribe RPC With gNMI Subscribe, specify -e proto flag to enable protobuf encoding.

Be it gNMI, NETCONF or RESTCONF a users still needs to have a path pointing to specific YANG-defined node which is targeted by a request. In gNMI paths can be represented in a human readable XPATH-like form - /a/b/c[key=val]/d - and these paths are based on the underlying YANG models. The problem at hand was how to get these paths interactively, or even better - walk the YANG tree from within the CLI and dynamically build the path used in a gNMI RPC? With YANG-completions feature embedded in gnmic what used to be a dream is now a reality \ud83c\udf89 Let us explain what just happened there. In the demonstration above, we called the gnmic with the well-known flags defining the gNMI target ( address , username , password ). But this time we also added a few YANG specific flags ( --file and --dir ) that load the full set of Nokia SR OS YANG models and the 3 rd party models SR OS rely on. gnmic --address 10.1.0.11 --insecure --username admin --password admin \\ --file ~/7x50_YangModels/YANG/nokia-combined \\ --dir ~/7x50_YangModels/YANG \\ prompt In the background gnmic processed these YANG models to build the entire schema tree of the Nokia SR OS state and configuration datastores. With that in-mem stored information, gnmic was able to auto-suggest all the possible YANG paths when the user entered the --path flag which accepts gNMI paths. By using the auto-suggestion hints, a user navigated the /state tree of a router and drilled down to the version-number leaf that, in the end, was retrieved with the gNMI Get RPC.

The prompt command leverages the --file and --dir flags to select the YANG models for processing. With the --file flag a user specifies a file path to a YANG file or a directory of them that gnmic will read and process. If it points to a directory it will be visited recursively reading in all *.yang files it finds. The --dir flag also points to a YANG file or a directory and indicates which additional YANG files might be required. For example, if the YANG modules that a user specified with the --file flag import or include modules that were not part of the path specified with --file , they need to be added with the --dir flag. The Examples section provide some good practical examples on how these two flags can be used together to process the YANG models from different vendors.","title":"YANG processing"},{"location":"advanced/prompt_suggestions/#understanding-path-suggestions","text":"When gnmic provides a user with the path suggestions it does it in a smart and intuitive way.
